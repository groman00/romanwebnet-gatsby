Oven roasted pork chops with home made spice rub.

<!-- excerpt end -->

## Ingredients

- 2-4 Boneless or Bone-in Pork Chops (about 1" thick)
- [Spice Mix Recipe](/recipes/spice-mix)

## Directions

### Step 1

Preheat your oven to 375°.

### Step 2

Grind spices with a mortar and pestle, if you have one, or mix in a bowl until well incorporated.

### Step 3

Lay out the pork chops on a plate or some parchment paper. Pat both sides dry with a paper towel. Carefully sprinkle your spice mix over the top and sides of your chops. Rub the mix firmly until the entire chop is evenly covered. Flip and repeat.

### Step 4

Line a baking dish with tin foil (dull side up) and spray lightly with cooking spray. Space the chops evenly on the sheet and bake for 18-20 minutes. Pork internal temperature should read 145°. For bone in chops, add 4-6 minutes to the cook time and make sure you test the temperature near the bone, but not touching the bone.

## Grill Method

Following steps 1-3, but instead heat your grill with one side on high and the other on medium. Lightly spray grill with cooking spray. Place chops on the side of the grill that is set on high. Grill for 3-4 minutes or until you see grill marks. Flip and move chops over to the medium side to finish cooking until Pork internal temperature reads 145°.
