## Ingredients

- 1 oven safe pie dish
- 1 baking sheet, larger than the pie dish
- 1 double pie crust. This recipe uses [Pillsbury Pie Crusts](https://www.pillsbury.com/products/pie-crust/refrigerated-pie-crust)
- 1 cup white sugar. If preferred, you can mix in brown sugar. Some sugar should be reserved to sprinkle on top.
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg. Fresh is preferred.
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 6-7 cups tart apples, such as Granny Smith, peeled and sliced.
- 2 tablespoons butter
- [optional] 2 small cloves, ground

## Directions

### Prepare the Pie

- Preheat oven to 425&deg;F
- Peel and slice apples and reserve in a large bowl. Stir in lemon juice.
- In a small bowl combine sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and salt.
- Mix some sugar mixture into the apples, about 1/4 cup. Apples should have a coating, but not too heavy.
- Place the bottom crust into the pie dish and sprinkle a layer of sugar mixture on the bottom to coat.
- Add a layer of apples and dust with sugar. Repeat with more layers and sugar until all the apples are used. If it seems like there are too many apples, leave some leftover for a snack on the side.
- Cut up 1.5 tablespoons of butter into small dots and distribute evenly throughout the pie.
- Layer the top crust over the pie and seal the edges with the bottom crust.
- Melt the remaining butter and brush all over the top crust
- Dust the buttered crust with the remaining sugar. You may not use all of it.
- Cut several vents on the pie

### Bake

- Place the pie dish on top of a baking sheet to prevent spill over.
- Move the baking sheet and pie into the center rack of the preheated oven.
- Bake for 50 minutes. Check the pie after 35-40 minutes to make sure it's not too dark or burning. If it is, you can shield the top with tin foil.
- Pie should be golden brown and apples are tender. If not, bake for 10 more minutes.
- Remove and let cool for a couple hours or overnight.
